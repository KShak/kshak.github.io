						I had the pleasure of visiting Yosemite twice during the summer. Both times I hiked <a href="http://www.yosemitehikes.com/yosemite-valley/mist-trail/mist-trail.htm">The Mist Trail</a> (Vernal and Nevada Falls). Unfortunately, I was focused more on the hikes than on taking pictures, but I did get a few and they summarize the scenery fairly well. Since the first trip was a bit rushed and more of a discovery experience, I was not able to swim in any of the pools above the waterfalls, but I wasted no time during the second trip getting to these pools. The water was cold and refreshing, especially since it was about 90 degrees Fahrenheit. I look forward to many more trips to Yosemite and I highly recommend a visit if you have not been.

						I have wanted to visit Europe since I started taking French classes in early middle school. My first trip was not to France, but rather to eastern Europe, mainly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>. The only bad experience was the fourteen-hour journeys which were surprisingly comfortable; I just dislike confined spaces with little to do. I now consider Bulgaria my second home as the people, places and food are absolutely amazing. Within Bulgaria, I was able to explore <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofia">Sofia</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plovdiv">Plovdiv</a>, two amazing cities with distinct and ancient cultures. Outside of Bulgaria, I was also able to travel to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ni%C5%A1">Niche</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia">Serbia</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thessaloniki">Thessaloniki</a> and <a href="http://www.enalion-hotel.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/olympicbeach211.165151846_std.jpg">Olympic Beach</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece">Greece</a>. What made me feel the most at home and welcomed aside from the people I was with was the lack of substantial tourism. The experience I was getting felt and was natural. I plan on returning to Bulgaria and exploring more of Europe in Winter 2015.

						Took a spontaneous trip with some friends the summer before starting college. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silverton,_Colorado">Silverton</a> is a small, old mining town. 9,318 feet above sea level. Stunning landscapes. Good people.
