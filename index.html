				<h4>
					About Me:
				</h4>
				<div align="center">
				<p>
					I am a third year Computer Science major at the University of California, Berkeley. I also dabble in Statistics and may end up with a minor depending on which CS courses will be offered in the future. My main interests at the moment are distributed systems, security and mobile development. Currently, I am in my second semester as a reader for <a id="image_info_link1" href="http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa15/">CS61B</a> (Data Structures and Algorithms) at Cal with plans to become an Undergraduate Student Instructor in the Spring when my schedule opens up a bit. Also, I am a Resident Assistant in one of the campus housing buildings where I develop community and help ensure incoming students integrate into college life well. On a separate note, I enjoy being surrounded by nature and when I am not doing any of the things mentioned above, in the winter you may find me snowboarding in Tahoe and in the summer you may find me hiking in Yosemite.
