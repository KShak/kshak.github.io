					About Me:
				</h4>
				<div align="center">
				<p>
					I am a third year Computer Science major at the University of California, Berkeley. I also dabble in Statistics and may end up with a minor depending on which CS courses will be offered in the future. My main interests at the moment are mobile development, security, and distributed systems. Currently, I am in my third semester as a reader for <a id="image_info_link1" href="http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa15/">CS61B</a> (Data Structures and Algorithms) at Cal with plans to become an Undergraduate Student Instructor in the Fall of my senior year when my schedule opens up a bit. Additionally, I am a Resident Assistant in one of the campus housing buildings where I develop community and help ensure incoming students integrate into college life well. On a separate note, I enjoy being surrounded by nature and when I am not doing any of the things mentioned above, in the winter you may find me snowboarding in Tahoe and in the summer you may find me hiking in Yosemite.

					About This Site:
				</h4>
				<div align="center">
				<p>
					This site was built using HTML and CSS. Originally, I used a bit of PHP to create an embedded "Contact Me" form but had to abandon this feature as <a id="image_info_link1" href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> does not support PHP and I am using my private Linux server for a side project. <!-- It is hosted by GitHub through their <a id="image_info_link1" href="https://pages.github.com/">Pages</a> service. --> Thank you for visiting!
